Question 9:

The Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model is used to
evaluate an organization's software development practices (i.e., process
maturity).  Illustrate the practices that would have to be in place to achieve
each of the following levels.  Hint:  discuss with respect to Key Process Areas
(KPAs).
a. Initial
    There are no formal practices in place.
b. Repeatable
    Managed, Requriements Management, Project Planning, Project Monitoring and
    Control, Supplier Agreement Management, Measurement and Analysis, Process
    and Product Quality Assurance, Configuration Management. 
c. Defined
    Requirements Development, Technical Solution, Product Integration,
    Verification, Validation, Organizational Process Focus, Organizational
    Process Definition, Organizational Training, Risk Management, Decision
    analysis and Resolution, Integrated Product and Process Development
    environment, Integrated Project Management, Integrated Project Management,
    Integrated Teaming, Integrated Supplier Management, Organizational
    Environment Integration.
d. Managed
    Organizational Process Performance, Quantitative Project Management
e. Optimizing
    Organizational Innovation and Deployment, Causal Analysis and Resolution,
    Continuous Process improvement.

Question 23:

Appendix B contains the contents of a Cucumber feature file for the
RottenPotatoes application.

a. Show the available regular expression steps from web_steps.rb that could be
    used to match the steps in the feature, and explain how they match the feature
    step (i.e., explain how the regular expression is constructed).
    
    /^(?:|I )press "([^"]*)"$/ do |button|
    /^(?:|I )follow "([^"]*)"$/ do |link|
    
    Any line containing 0 or 1 ':' or an I, followed by the word that is not
    captured (press and follow, respectively) and then a quote delimited string
    is captured. The quote delimited string is the button or link that is being
    accessed for the test.

b. Show the additional regular expression steps in ruby that would have to be
    added, and explain how they would match.

    /I (un)?check the following ratings: (.*)/ do |uncheck, rating_list|
    /^the following movies exist:$/ do |movies_table|
    /I should not see any of the movies/ do
    /I should see all of the movies/ do

    For the last three, the initial strings are matched to their respective
    actions, which are excecuted. The first expression is different because it
    captures the "un" in "uncheck". If it happens to have any characters in that
    captured set, the box is unchecked, otherwise it is not.
    

    Appendix B
    Background: movies have been added to database
    
        Given the following movies exist:
        | title | rating | release_date |
        | Aladdin | G | 25-Nov-1992 |
        | The Terminator | R | 26-Oct-1984 |
        | When Harry Met Sally | R | 21-Jul-1989 |
        | The Help | PG-13 | 10-Aug-2011 |
        | Chocolat | PG-13 | 5-Jan-2001 |
        | Amelie | R | 25-Apr-2001 |
        | 2001: A Space Odyssey | G | 6-Apr-1968 |
        | The Incredibles | PG | 5-Nov-2004 |
        | Raiders of the Lost Ark | PG | 12-Jun-1981 |
        | Chicken Run | G | 21-Jun-2000 |

        And I am on the RottenPotatoes home page
        And I check the following ratings: G PG PG-13 R
        And I press "Refresh"

    Scenario: sort movies alphabetically
        When I follow "Movie Title"
        Then I should see all movies sorted by title in increasing order
    Scenario: sort movies in increasing order of release date
        When I follow "Release Date"
        Then I should see all movies sorted by release date in increasing order

Question 39:

Lessons Learned (Everyone must answer!):  
Most organizations carry out a postmortem (i.e., after delivery and acceptance)
analysis of a project. In it, they assess all aspects of the project including
products, process and resources with the intent of identifying both what well in
the project and what areas should be improved upon in future projects. Before
a formal postmortem, each team member does a self-assessment, called a Lessons
Learned document. Write your own sections of our Lessons Learned document for
the class by summarizing: 

a. What were the most important (to you, personally)
    The most important part of taking this course was being able to familiarize
    myself with the workflow of a software engineer. Although this was
    accomplished to a great extent, I'm not sure that I've been adequately
    familiarized with the tools and skills. Ultimately the course accomplished
    the main goal, but still left something do be desired.

b.  Note any concepts, principles, skills, tools, etc. that you would have liked
to learn, but that we didn't cover.  
    I wolud have liked to spent more time truly understanding Rails. It's a very
    different procedure to simply go through some tutorials, and go through a
    true learning process. I felt that a lot of the assignments and projects
    were demanding a very simple process without explaining the underlying
    fundamentals. If I were going to learn Rails on my own, I would probably
    just read through railstutorial.org slowly and carefully until I felt
    comfortable enough to start a small project myself. Only then would I feel
    comfortable enough to join another project and contribute.

c.  List all everything that you feel you did especially well this semester
(master specific tools, languages, skills, etc.; contribute to the project in a
specific way, etc., learn and implement specific things quickly, etc.).  
    I am very familiar with Agile methodologies and managing assignments in a
    work environment.

d.  List anything that that you feel that you didn't do as well, or that didn't
go as well as you hoped (getting a list of these items will help me to better
schedule material for future semesters).  e.  THANK YOU!
    I don't feel like I was familiar enough with the tools before starting on
    the agile-ventures project. I had just been introduced and done a couple of
    simple tutorials on a very simple project. This course would be better if
    the final was treated as extra credit. There is simply too much that was
    left unlearned before starting the project. That time would be better spent
    taking the time to learn the tools to their fullest extent.
